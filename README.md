# Virtual-Queue
In this project I created a web site just for the base and functionality of the next things.<br>
1- Maze that is procedurally created.<br>
2- Virtual queue that allows you to fulfill requests in real-time from an admin page. (Similar to web sites of tickets like Ticketmaster)<br>

## Hard to mount due to servers, database and correct function of all the parts.
